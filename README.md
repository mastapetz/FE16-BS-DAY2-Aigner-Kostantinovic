Warm up questions
Please discuss the following questions with your pair partner:

Do you know what the default font stack in Bootstrap is?

What do we need to do to get nice looking tables in Bootstrap?

How many Bootstrap layout components do you know?

Bootstrap provides a few different options for styling navigation elements, how many do you know?

What is the purpose of the modal window?

Basic : Adding Navbars
We will continue to improve our example that we re-used on day 1  (from the section "Basic Bootstrap Template") our list of technologies that we know so far - feel free to add Bootstrap components now! Create several different versions of this template with some navbars: use fixed top navbar or fixed bottom navbar in the first version, and create also a responsive inverted/dark navbar in a second version. Feel free to create a few more versions based on your inspiration.

Advanced Exercise | Navigation
Let's play a little bit with drop-down navigation elements. You should create a template that can provide the basic information about your favorite movie. At the top navigation, you should have at least three menu items in the menu. On the left side, you should have a stackable navigation(tip: see vertical pills). On the right side, you should have the content about your favorite movie. You can find the movie description on the Internet, as well as images and create a nice responsive web page which will represent your favorite movie in the best way. Feel free to use as many Bootstrap elements as you want. Be creative! You can create more pages with the same layout and link them.      



Here you have an example of how this could be structured:

Challenge

Challenge | Travel Agency website
Are you satisfied how you represented your favorite movie using Bootstrap and responsive design? Now it is time to create a website for the travel agency "Mount Everest" (based in Vienna). They want a nice looking responsive website and they insist on using the Bootstrap framework. They want to present their offers, destinations and client recommendations. It is extremely important for them to have a mobile-friendly website. You should add a Hero section on an appropriate location. Insert the most popular destination with some text and a nice background image. Feel free to add more Bootstrap components to this website and create at least two more pages.

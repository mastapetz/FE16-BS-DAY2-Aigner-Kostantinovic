        <h2>The Movies</h2>
        <p>
          The original trillogie set standards for story telling and Visual
          effects <br />
          especially thr first and the third movie had lot of positive
          feedback
        </p>
        <p>
          Be it for the long wait time between the second and the third movie,
          or other reasons <br />
          The second movie was the least liked. It also seemed to be
          <em>a lot goofier</em> in certain scenes than the other two

        <h2>The Game<i>s</i></h2>
        <p>
          There were several Games, some more known, some hyped but
          <strong> ultimately crashed</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The most famous of them, which also failed very quick was the
          <i>planned</i> MMO
        </p>
        <p>
          Games on various home consoles mostly were only played by the
          biggest movie fans but not well regarded

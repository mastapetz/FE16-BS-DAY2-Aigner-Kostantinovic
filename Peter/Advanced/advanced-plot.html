        <h1>The Matrix</h1>

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c1/The_Matrix_Poster.jpg" alt="" class="ps-5">

        <p>
            It depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality, the
            Matrix, which intelligent machines have created to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy
            source.
        </p>
        <p>Computer programmer Thomas Anderson, known by his hacking alias "Neo", is puzzled by repeated online
            encounters with the phrase "the Matrix". Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named Morpheus has the
            answers Neo seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by Agent Smith, arrives at Neo's workplace in search of
            him. Though Morpheus attempts to guide Neo to safety, Neo surrenders rather than risk a dangerous escape.
            The Agents attempt to coerce Neo into helping them locate Morpheus, who they claim is a terrorist. When Neo
            refuses, the Agents fuse his mouth shut and implant a robotic "bug" in his stomach. Neo wakes up from what
            he believes to be a nightmare. Soon after, Neo is taken by Trinity to meet Morpheus, and she removes the bug
            from Neo, indicating that the "nightmare" he experienced was apparently real.
            Morpheus offers Neo a choice between two pills: red to reveal the truth about the Matrix, and blue to forget
            everything and return to his former life.</p>
